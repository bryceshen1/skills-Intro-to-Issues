When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds:

1. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the issue created in your repository.
3. If the page doesn't refresh automatically, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.
   - Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.
   - If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
